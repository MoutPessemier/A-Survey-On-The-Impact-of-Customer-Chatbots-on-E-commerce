It aims to organize critical information that is a necessary background for further research activity in the field of chatbots. More specifically, while giving the historical evolution, from the generative idea to the present day, we point out possible weaknesses of each stage. After we present a complete categorization system, we analyze the two essential implementation technologies, namely, the pattern matching approach and machine learning. Moreover, we compose a general architectural design that gathers critical details, and we highlight crucial issues to take into account before system design. Furthermore, we present chatbots applications and industrial use cases while we point out the risks of using chatbots and suggest ways to mitigate them. Finally, we conclude by stating our view regarding the direction of technology so that chatbots will become really smart.},

	abstract = {Chatbots are one class of intelligent, conversational software agents activated by natural language input (which can be in the form of text, voice, or both). They provide conversational output in response, and if commanded, can sometimes also execute tasks. Although chatbot technologies have existed since the 1960's and have influenced user interface development in games since the early 1980's, chatbots are now easier to train and implement. This is due to plentiful open source code, widely available development platforms, and implementation options via Software as a Service (SaaS). In addition to enhancing customer experiences and supporting learning, chatbots can also be used to engineer social harm-that is, to spread rumors and misinformation, or attack people for posting their thoughts and opinions online. This paper presents a literature review of quality issues and attributes as they relate to the contemporary issue of chatbot development and implementation. Finally, quality assessment approaches are reviewed, and a quality assessment method based on these attributes and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is proposed and examined.},

Conversational software agents activated by natural language processing is known as chatbot, are an excellent example of such machine. This paper presents a survey on existing chatbots and techniques applied into it. It discusses the similarities, differences and limitations of the existing chatbots. We compared 11 most popular chatbot application systems along with functionalities and technical specifications. Research showed that nearly 75\% of customers have experienced poor customer service and generation of meaningful, long and informative responses remains a challenging task. In the past, methods for developing chatbots have relied on hand-written rules and templates. With the rise of deep learning these models were quickly replaced by end-to-end neural networks. More specifically, Deep Neural Networks is a powerful generative-based model to solve the conversational response generation problems. This paper conducted an in-depth survey of recent literature, examining over 70 publications related to chatbots published in the last 5 years. Based on literature review, this study made a comparison from selected papers according to method adopted. This paper also presented why current chatbot models fails to take into account when generating responses and how this affects the quality conversation.},

In our paper, we aim at exploring which are the concepts that require being more elaborated before putting the standard to work. Specifically, with respect to the part 1 of the standard we focus on the hierarchical form of the quality entities (i.e., characteristics, subcharacteristics and attributes) that appear in quality models; we propose some criteria to distinguish among subcharacteristics and attributes; we distinguish among derived attributes and basic attributes; and we propose an extension for covering not only technical factors but also managerial and political ones. Concerning the other 3 parts of the standard (one of them currently pending of approval), we distinguish different categorization criteria of metrics (scale, type, objectivity, qualitative/quantitative) and we make explicit the rationale behind their definition with the Goal-Question-Metric approach. As a final contribution, we show the use of UML class diagrams for representing all the concepts of the standard and their relationships, and we highlight the need for having tool support for quality model development and metrics definition.},

While there is an emerging body of research concerning user uptake and use of chatbots, there is a lack of theoretically grounded studies detailing what constitutes good or poor chatbot user experiences. In this paper, we present findings from a questionnaire study involving more than 200 chatbot users who reported on episodes of chatbot use that they found particularly satisfactory or frustrating. The user reports were analysed with basis in theory on user experience, with particular concern for pragmatic and hedonic attributes. We found that pragmatic attributes such as efficient assistance (positive) and problems with interpretation (negative) were important elements in user reports of satisfactory and frustrating episodes. Hedonic attributes such as entertainment value (positive) and strange and rude responses (negative) were also frequently mentioned. Older participants tended to report on pragmatic attributes more often, whereas younger participants tended to report on hedonic attributes more often. Drawing on the findings, we propose four high-level lessons learnt that may benefit chatbot service providers, and we suggest relevant future research.},

	abstract = {The current qualitative interview study describes the communication journey of customers who wish to contact companies, and their evaluation of chatbot communication within this journey. Interviews were conducted with a sample (N=24) that was varied in terms of gender, age, educational level and household composition. Experiences with nine customer service chatbots were included. The analysis focuses on three stages in the journey: first, customers' prior expectations when contacting a company; second, their experiences during chatbot conversations, and third, their final conclusions about under which conditions customer service chatbots should be implemented, and the consequences of chatbot communication for customers' company perceptions. Implications for research and practice are discussed. 1 Introduction Developments in AI fundamentally alter how companies communicate with their customers [9]. Particularly in customer service, chatbots are increasingly implemented [7, 11, 12]. Customers who need information or who want to complain can type their questions in a dialogue screen (often looking like a chat interface), and receive answers in natural language. The essential characteristic of this type of communication is that, although the answers are automatically generated, the conversation is made to resemble a dialogue between humans [7]. Since this is a novel way of interacting with a company, the question arises how customers experience these conversations, and how this communication affects their company perceptions. The current qualitative interview study aims to shed light on these issues by describing the communication journey of customers who wish to contact companies, and their evaluation of chatbot communication within this journey. The analysis focuses on three stages in the journey: first, customers' prior expectations when contacting a company; second, their experiences during chat-bot conversations, and third, their final conclusions about under which conditions customer service chatbots should be implemented, and the consequences of chatbot communication for customers'company perceptions.},

Today, human chat service agents are frequently replaced by conversational software agents or chatbots, which are systems designed to communicate with human users by means of natural language often¬†based on artificial intelligence (AI). Though cost- and time-saving opportunities triggered a widespread implementation of AI-based chatbots, they still frequently fail to meet customer expectations, potentially resulting in users being less inclined to comply with requests made by the chatbot. Drawing on social response and commitment-consistency theory, we empirically examine through a randomized online experiment how verbal anthropomorphic design cues and the foot-in-the-door technique affect user request compliance. Our results demonstrate that both anthropomorphism as well as the need to stay consistent significantly increase the likelihood that users comply with a chatbot‚Äôs request for service feedback.

	abstract = {Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots have brought unprecedented business potential. This study aims to explore consumers' trust and response to a text-based chatbot in e-commerce, involving the moderating effects of task complexity and chatbot identity disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: A survey method with 299 useable responses was conducted in this research. This study adopted the ordinary least squares regression to test the hypotheses. Findings: First, the consumers' perception of both the empathy and friendliness of the chatbot positively impacts their trust in it. Second, task complexity negatively moderates the relationship between friendliness and consumers' trust. Third, disclosure of the text-based chatbot negatively moderates the relationship between empathy and consumers' trust, while it positively moderates the relationship between friendliness and consumers' trust. Fourth, consumers' trust in the chatbot increases their reliance on the chatbot and decreases their resistance to the chatbot in future interactions. Research limitations/implications: Adopting the stimulus‚Äìorganism‚Äìresponse (SOR) framework, this study provides important insights on consumers' perception and response to the text-based chatbot. The findings of this research also make suggestions that can increase consumers' positive responses to text-based chatbots. Originality/value: Extant studies have investigated the effects of automated bots' attributes on consumers' perceptions. However, the boundary conditions of these effects are largely ignored. This research is one of the first attempts to provide a deep understanding of consumers' responses to a chatbot.},

This study investigates the extent to which chatbots with human-like cues influence perceptions of anthropomorphism (i.e., attribution of human-like characteristics), privacy concerns, and consequently, information disclosure, attitudes and recommendation adherence. Findings show that a human-like chatbot leads to more information disclosure, and recommendation adherence mediated by higher perceived anthropomorphism and subsequently, lower privacy concerns in comparison to a machine-like chatbot. This result does not hold in comparison to a website; human-like chatbot and website were perceived as equally high in anthropomorphism. The results show the importance of both mediating concepts in regards to attitudinal and behavioral outcomes when interacting with chatbots.},

	abstract = {Computer-generated anthropomorphic characters are a growing type of communicator that is deployed in digital communication environments. An essential theoretical question is how people identify humanlike but clearly artificial, hence humanoid, entities in comparison to natural human ones. This identity categorization inquiry was approached under the framework of consistency and tested through examining inconsistency effects from mismatching categories. Study 1 (N = 80), incorporating a self-disclosure task, tested participants' responses to a talking-face agent, which varied in four combinations of human versus humanoid faces and voices. In line with the literature on inconsistency, the pairing of a human face with a humanoid voice or a humanoid face with a human voice led to longer processing time in making judgment of the agent and less trust than the pairing of a face and a voice from either the human or the humanoid category. Female users particularly showed negative attitudes toward inconsistently paired talking faces. Study 2 (N = 80), using a task that stressed comprehension demand, replicated the inconsistency effects on judging time and females' negative attitudes but not for comprehension-related outcomes. Voice clarity overshadowed the consistency concern for comprehension-related responses. The overall inconsistency effects suggest that people treat humanoid entities in a different category from natural human ones. ¬© 2007 International Communication Association.},

	abstract = {In analyzing the human tendency to treat computers as social actors (CASA), researchers tend to rule out the anthropomorphism explanation because anthropomorphism is understood to be "a sincere, conscious belief" that computers are human and/or deserving of human attributions. But, does anthropomorphism have to be necessarily mindful? Could it not also be a mindless tendency, especially given that most of us have somewhat long associations with our computers and have built human-like bonds with them? We examined these questions empirically by investigating whether the user tendency to treat computers as human beings is conscious (mindful) or non-conscious (mindless). We manipulated two variables (presence/absence of human-like agent and the low/high interactivity) on a health website and experimentally investigated whether they serve as anthropomorphic cues to trigger mindful attributions of human-ness to the website or mindless evaluations of the site in human terms. We found evidence for mindless anthropomorphism, with implications for user judgments of credibility of information on the site. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It specifically tested the influence of anthropomorphism and agency on the level of uncertainty and social judgment, using a between-subjects experimental design. Anthropomorphism had three levels; a high anthropomorphic image, a low anthropomorphic image and no image. Agency had two levels; whether the participants were told they were interacting with a human (avatar condition) or a computer (agent condition). The results showed that the virtual image influenced social judgment. The less anthropomorphic image was perceived to be more credible and likeable than no image, which was more credible and likeable than the anthropomorphic image. There were no discernable differences in social judgment between participants who were told they were interacting with a human as compared to those told they were interacting with a computer agent, consistent with findings from previous reports. Neither anthropomorphism nor agency influenced reported levels of uncertainty. Implications of these results for those designing and using virtual environments are discussed.},

To bridge this knowledge gap, we present a questionnaire study (N = 154) that investigated factors of relevance for trust in customer service chatbots. The study included two parts: an explanatory investigation of the relative importance of factors known to predict trust from the general literature on interactive systems and an exploratory identification of other factors of particular relevance for trust in chatbots. The participants were recruited as part of their dialogue with one of four chatbots for customer service.

In a retail context, chatbots allow humans to pose shopping-related questions and receive answers in natural language without waiting for a salesperson or using other automated communication forms. However, until now, it has been unclear which customers accept this new communication form and which factors determine their acceptance. In this paper, we contrast the well-known technology acceptance model (TAM) with the lesser known uses and gratifications (U\&G) theory, applying both approaches to measure the acceptance of the text-based ‚ÄúEmma‚Äù chatbot by its target segment. ‚ÄúEmma‚Äù was developed for the prepurchase phase of online fashion retailing and integrated into Facebook Messenger by the major German online retailer Zalando. Data were collected from 205 German Millennial respondents in a usability study. The results show that both utilitarian factors such as ‚Äúauthenticity of conversation‚Äù and ‚Äúperceived usefulness,‚Äù as well as hedonic factors such as ‚Äúperceived enjoyment‚Äù, positively influence the acceptance of ‚ÄúEmma‚Äù.

Interviews were conducted with a sample (N=24) that was varied in terms of gender, age, educational level and household composition. Experiences with nine customer service chatbots were included. The analysis focuses on three stages in the journey: first, customers' prior expectations when contacting a company; second, their experiences during chatbot conversations, and third, their final conclusions about under which conditions customer service chatbots should be implemented, and the consequences of chatbot communication for customers' company perceptions. Implications for research and practice are discussed. 1 Introduction Developments in AI fundamentally alter how companies communicate with their customers [9]. Particularly in customer service, chatbots are increasingly implemented [7, 11, 12]. Customers who need information or who want to complain can type their questions in a dialogue screen (often looking like a chat interface), and receive answers in natural language. The essential characteristic of this type of communication is that, although the answers are automatically generated, the conversation is made to resemble a dialogue between humans [7]. Since this is a novel way of interacting with a company, the question arises how customers experience these conversations, and how this communication affects their company perceptions. The current qualitative interview study aims to shed light on these issues by describing the communication journey of customers who wish to contact companies, and their evaluation of chatbot communication within this journey. The analysis focuses on three stages in the journey: first, customers' prior expectations when contacting a company; second, their experiences during chat-bot conversations, and third, their final conclusions about under which conditions customer service chatbots should be implemented, and the consequences of chatbot communication for customers'company perceptions.},

	abstract = {Chatbots are very much an emerging technology, and there is still much to learn about how conversational user interfaces will affect the way in which humans communicate not only with computers but also with one another. Further studies on anthropomorphic agents and the projection of human characteristics onto a system are required to further develop this area. Gender stereotypes operate a profound effect on human behaviour. The application of gender to a conversational agent brings along with it the projection of user biases and preconceptions. These feelings and perceptions about an agent can be used to develop mental models of a system. Users can be inclined to measure the success of a system based on their biases and emotional connections with the agent rather than that of the system's performance. There have been many studies that show how gender affects human perceptions of a conversational agent. However, there is limited research on the effect of gender when applied to a chatbot system. This chapter presents early results from a research study which indicate that chatbot gender does have an effect on users overall satisfaction and gender-stereotypical perception. Subsequent studies could focus on examining the ethical implications of the results and further expanding the research by increasing the sample size to validate statistical significance, as well as recruiting a more diverse sample size from various backgrounds and experiences. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Many studies have indicated how gender affects human perceptions of a conversational agent. However, there is limited research on the effect of gender when applied to a chatbot system. This research study presents early results which indicate that chatbot gender does have an effect on users overall satisfaction and gender-stereotypical perception. Users are more likely to apply gender stereotypes when a chatbot system operates within a gender-stereotypical subject domain, such as mechanics, and when the chatbot gender does not conform to gender stereotypes. This study raise ethical issues. Should we exploit this result and perpetuate the bias and stereotyping? Should we really have a male chatbot for technical advice bots? Is this perpetuating stereotyping, the dilemma being that a male version would elicit more trust?},

We examined, in a banking services context, whether consumers preferred AI or Human online customer service applications using an experimental design across three field-based experiments. The results show that, in the case of low-complexity tasks, consumers considered the problem-solving ability of AI to be greater than that of human customer service and were more likely to use AI while, conversely, for high-complexity tasks, they viewed human customer service as superior and were more likely to use it than AI. Moreover, we found that perceived problem-solving ability mediated the effects of customers‚Äô service usage intentions (i.e., their preference for AI vs. Human) with task complexity serving as a boundary condition.

	abstract = {Users are rapidly turning to social media to request and receive customer service; however, a majority of these requests were not addressed timely or even not addressed at all. To overcome the problem, we create a new conversational system to automatically generate responses for users requests on social media. Our system is integrated with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and is trained by nearly 1M Twitter conversations between users and agents from over 60 brands. The evaluation reveals that over 40\% of the requests are emotional, and the system is about as good as human agents in showing empathy to help users cope with emotional situations. Results also show our system outperforms information retrieval system based on both human judgments and an automatic evaluation metric.},
