\textbf{W.I.P}

\section{Limitations of this work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Age bias: due to our survey being filled in mostly by peers of our age, there is an age bias towards 20-30
	\item Specificity: due the the very specific nature of respondents needed in the survey, there was only a limited number of responses
\end{itemize}

\section{Possibilities of future research}
\begin{itemize}
	\item More attributes to inspect
	\item Same research for other sectors
\end{itemize}
