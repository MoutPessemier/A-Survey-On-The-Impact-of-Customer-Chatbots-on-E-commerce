Users’ experiences with chatbots: findings from a questionnaire study


Conditions for the use of chatbots
- For chatbots to be broadly adopted by users, it is critical that they are experienced as useful and pleasurable.
- In the general research literature on interactive systems, it is well established that user experience is decisive for the uptake of such systems in user populations [28].

Advantages of using chatbots
- They allow for eﬃcient interactions with users on private messaging platforms and in virtual assistants, and interactions are familiar and low threshold [20].


Ultimate goal of chatbots
- However, the full potential of chatbots is still not realized, in part due to challenges associated with changing user needs and motivations [4].
- In short, chatbots need to be developed and designed with the aim of strengthening user experience.
- Good chatbot user experience is created through useful and eﬃcient interactions
- productivity was the key motivator for most users, fol-lowed by entertainment.
- users prefer a chatbot personality that reﬂects both productivity and engagement.


Differences between user interaction and chatbot interaction
- Hill et al. [27] compared user interactions with a chatbot to user interactions during chats with other users and found that chatting with chatbots involved longer conversations with more and shorter messages and less richness than what was found in chats with other users.


Negative experiences of chatbots
- when the chatbot is challenged to correctly interpret the users’ intention or is unable to provide eﬀective assistance.
- Premature launch
- out-of-place or even rude responses,


If we want to evaluate user experience (UX) in our study/survey, we should look into Hassenzahl’s framework and split up our attributes into pragmatic and hedonic attributes

Also make make sure to talk about the two different types of chatbots: task-oriented versus social-oriented chatbots
