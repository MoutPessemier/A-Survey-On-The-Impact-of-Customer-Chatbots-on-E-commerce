Customer Service Chatbots: A Qualitative Interview Study into Customers’ Communication Journey


General
- Developments in AI fundamentally alter how companies communicate with their customers [9]. Particularly in customer service, chatbots are increasingly implemented [7, 11, 12].
- The essential characteristic of this type of communication is that, although the answers are automatically generated, the conversation is made to resemble a dialogue between humans [7].
- Since this is a novel way of interacting with a company, the question arises how customers experience these conversations, and how this communication affects their company perceptions.
- First, previous studies have already shown that the prime motivation for the use of customer service chatbots is to get their (simple) customer queries answered in a fast and convenient matter [6, 13].


Prior expectations
- the primary reason for customers to enter a conversation with a customer service chatbot is to get their (simple) customer queries answered in a fast and convenient manner [3, 5, 6, 13].
- This implies that the key to succesful chatbot communication in customer service is that the queries are answered in a correct and fast way.
- the mood people are in may determine their experiences during the chatbot conversation.

Experiences during
- The design aspect that received most attention both academic research as humanization of chatbots [6, 7]
- Humanizing chatbots can be done by adding anthropomorphic cues such as a name, persona, and by using a conversational language style with dialogical cues [8].
- Quite some experimental studies have manipulated specific anthropomorphic cues in chatbots to assess the effects of such cues [2, 8, 9]. (heel interessant om verder op te gaan werken!)
- It is relevant to place this humanization in the broader context of the overall user experience during a chatbot conversation. In the aforementioned qualitative study, Følstad and Skjuve found that customers experienced humanization and language style as less important than whether they received help with their enquiries [6].


RESULTS

RQ1:
- The interviewees expressed clear expectations of companies. Of utmost importance is getting their question answered or complaint addressed. This needs to be done fast (directly, within a few hours, for some questions a few days could be fine). They want to be taken seriously, and they want to be helped in a friendly manner.
- In terms of preferred modes of communication, we can distinguish “phone callers” and “typers”. “Phone callers” are interviewees who emphasized human contact, hearing someone’s voice, being able to ask follow-up questions and talking back and forth to come to an answer. Talking to a person makes it more direct and honest, and one immediately gets an answer. One can also express frustrations. The disadvantages of calling are the waiting times, that call center agents sometimes work with sale scripts, and that it is not available 24/7. “Typers” were the interviewees who preferred e-mailing or live chat (i.e., chatting with a human being). They indicated that they sometimes feel less comfortable with talking on the phone, and that they feel the need for having the information in writing for later referral. An additional advantage is multitasking: being able to send a mail or chat message while being at work.
- Reasons for using chatbots were: finding information (comparing the function of chatbots to Google), being able to contact the company outside of office hours, and getting through to a live chat. 
- Chatbots do not understand their questions and keep asking “do I understand you correctly?” --> frustration and anger

RQ2:
- Prerequisite: Receiving Adequate Help.
	- Even though this interviewee judges this chat as “perfect”, he does not see chatbot communication as sufficient enough to function as a stand-alone mode of communication. According to him, communication with a human is still required in case of problems, for instance when a package has not been delivered. 
	- What interviewees particularly appreciated was that some chatbot conversations helped to filter information or that the chatbot provided links where the interviewee could find the information
	- In quite some cases, the chatbot did not meet the requirement of answering the question satisfactorily. The interviews clearly showed us how this leads to quite some frustration
- Effort: The interviews clearly revealed that it takes quite some effort for customers to use chatbots.
	- Starting the chatbot conversation, some interviewees were wondering and estimating whether this chatbot would actually be able to answer their question. Some of them thought that for simple questions it may work, but not for more complicated questions.
	- "you need to use the right key words"-->  A complication here is that chatbots currently available do not all operate the same way: some indeed work best with key words as input, whereas others instruct the user to type full sentences like in human-human conversations.
	- It was quite common that, after typing the question, the chatbot did not come back with a relevant answer, and the interviewee needed to reformulate the question, sometimes several times
- Simulation of Human Touch: An essential feature of chatbot communication is that it can appear humanlike due to anthropomorphic cues and its conversational nature.
	- Interviewees typically saw the conversation as a automated chat with a simulated human touch to it
	- the opinions about simulating human interaction varies from liking it, to hating it and feeling betrayed when they find out it's a chatbot, not a human
- Language Style: One of the essential aspects of chatbot development is conversational design.
	- friendly enough or not
	- formal vs informal language

RQ3: 
- On the positive side, interviewees concluded that chatbots have the potential to be helpful for certain purposes. Chatbots were considered to be good at helping with searching information. Some interviewees applaud the speed, and the 24/7 availability.
- Overall, interviewees were pretty clear that chatbots can be helpful for general and simple questions: it is perceived as a type of frequently asked questions, but presented in another way. If working well, it could also serve as a type of filtering, before being transferred to human agent
- However, interviewees were unified in that chatbots can not function as a standalone mode of communication, and that it can not replace human communication
- Especially for personal and/or complex questions interviewees deem chatbots not useful because empathy is lacking

- Company Perceptions. So what do these experiences tell the interviewees about the companies? 
	- On the positive end, some interviewees saw the companies as innovative. 
	- Some also saw it as a service for customers. 
	- However, interviewees typically thought that the implementation of chatbots was done more for the company itself than for the customers
	- It looks they wanted to do it as cheap as possible. They did not pay attention to making it a bit nicer. Either they did not make an effort to find out how that could be done, or they did not come up with the right ideas to make it nicer. --> save costs
	- Some interviewees were also surprised about how bad the technology still is, especially when one had higher expectations of the level of innovation of a particular company
