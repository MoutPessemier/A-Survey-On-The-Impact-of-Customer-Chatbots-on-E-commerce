CONVERSATIONAL SURVEY CHATBOT: USER EXPERIENCE AND PERCEPTION


Obstacles with the use of chatbots
- Still, the main obstacle, in general, is the lack of social capabilities of chatbots.
- Besides these difficulties, the main problem today is that users are not willing to respond to online surveys anymore, or they will spend a max of 5 min answering the questions regardless of the size of the survey. [2]
- Despite the benefits, there is a lot of issues. Recent research shows that chatbots still fail to meet users’ expectations because of the lack of social capabilities [4].
- people are afraid of chatbot could use some of their private data for unknown purposes. 
- People are also expecting that chatbot can answer questions like a human.
- people are usually dissatisfied when they realize that a chatbot can provide them with false answers


Why users only spend 5 min answering surveys:
- The main reasons are decreasing human attention span, and due to the bad overall survey design (relevance, format, structure and so on), the respondents get bored very fast. [3] 


What is a chatbot?
- Chatbots are conversational software systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques with which users interact through natural language dialogue, by text or voice. [5]
- An AI-based chatbot is a conversational system that is designed to emulate human communication with capabilities to understand natural language, identify meaning, emotion, intention, and provide meaningful responses
- conversational agents can be categorized into [6]:
1. Speech-based CA (e.g., Siri, Alexa)
2. Text-messaging based CA (e.g. Messenger bots, Google Assistant)
3. Multimodal CA.


What is a chatbot survey?
- A chatbot survey or “conversational survey” is an online survey presented in a form of conversation where respondees, instead of answering static questions, are engaged in a conversational exchange with a bot persona.


Purpose of chatbots?
- While chatbots were initially designed to mimic human-to-human communication, current chatbots are typically task-oriented, assisting users to complete a certain task or achieve specific goals.
