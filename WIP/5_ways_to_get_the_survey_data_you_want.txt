5 ways to get the survey data you want

How to entice people to fill in your survey:
1. Go online:
Don't distribute your survey via e.g. mail, it is important to open up your survey online so that it is very accessible to the general public.

2. Keep it short:
Keep it short (when possible), a survey that is too long will cause people to drop out. A survey should take about between 6-10 minutes to complete.

3. Consider incentives:
Start rewarding your audience if they completed the survey completely. It is very important to make sure that people don't just take your survey to win a prize, because this
data will provide no added value to the survey. So think carefully about the reward.

4. Be clear and applicable:
It is important to ask clear questions. Questions that are not clearly drafted will create unrepresentative data, people will go over your question very quickly.

5. Follow up:
A small but significant portion of the audience that completes your survey actually cares about the final outcome of your research. So keep your audience informed as well.
It is important to show that you are very grateful to the people who completed your survey. You can tell those who are interested what exactly you are going to do with the data,
or you can share the final results of the survey.
